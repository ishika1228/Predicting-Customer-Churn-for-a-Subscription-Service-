📉 Customer Churn Prediction for a Subscription Service
🚀 A Machine Learning project to predict customer churn in a subscription-based video streaming service. This project analyzes customer demographics, subscription plans, and usage patterns to identify customers at risk of churning and provides actionable insights for retention strategies.

📌 Project Overview
A video streaming company wants to reduce customer churn (users canceling their subscriptions). This project:
✅ Explores customer data to identify patterns in churn behavior.
✅ Builds predictive models to classify at-risk customers.
✅ Provides insights for customer retention strategies.

📂 Dataset
📍 Dataset Name: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
📍 Fields Included:

Customer ID – Unique identifier for each user.
Age – Customer’s age.
Gender – Male/Female.
Subscription Plan – (Basic, Standard, Premium).
Monthly Charges – Subscription fee.
Total Usage Hours – Hours watched last month.
Support Tickets – Number of complaints raised.
Churn – (1 = Churned, 0 = Active).

🎯 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Exploration
Summarize the dataset (check missing values, outliers).
Analyze patterns in churn behavior (e.g., do customers with low watch time churn more?).
2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values.
Normalize numerical features (Monthly Charges, Total Usage Hours).
Encode categorical variables (Gender, Subscription Plan).
3️⃣ Model Development
Split data into training & testing sets.
Train models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
4️⃣ Insights & Recommendations
Identify top factors influencing churn.
Suggest retention strategies (discounts, better customer support).
📊 Key Metrics Used
✔ Accuracy – How well the model predicts churn.
✔ Precision & Recall – Model performance on positive churn cases.
✔ F1-score – Balance between precision & recall.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit.
🔹 Improve prediction with deep learning models.
🔹 Use real-time data streaming for churn alerts.
